so far just an album of raster graphics ([see Facebook album for ease of viewing](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10207286983425807.1073741883.1021481015&type=1&l=86fa398ebf)) made from the original scalable vector graphics (.svg) which you can find in [/img/svg] folder of [this repo on github](https://github.com/weAreThePlayMakers/ecceHomo-2015-16-edition).

ecceHomo 15/16 is intended as a graphical journal, documenting work with artists and creators from across various industries and fields of human expression.

you might recognise yourself on some of the graphics, please feel free to tag yourself and/or drop your feedback.

you might also recognise representations of your works. usually these representations are largely unrecognisable as the process of triangulating the pictures on which graphics are based modifies the picture to an extent where the details are lost and graphics become somewhat removed from their original setting. this was the intention.

in most cases i would hope to have references where other peoples work is visible (eiffel tower, pyramids, mona lisa or any other painting in the gallery would reference the original creators) but often keeping track of all the names and labels is very difficult especially considering the nature of this journal.

for more detail as to this nature and ethos behind ecceHomo series see the initial [ecceHomo - 2013 edition](http://eccehomo-2013.surge.sh/#/). and [check the repo for more info as well as the source code](https://github.com/weAreThePlayMakers/ecceHomo-2013-edition)
